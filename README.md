# rcon
Archive of old and trusty rcon client.

# purpose
This is repo to ease my dockerization efforts on various Steam games. Actual rcon code isn't written by me, this is just easiest way to make it available and preserve it's existence for the future.

# credits
Code was found from here: https://www.ryanschulze.net/archives/1052
And that is archive of original location of: http://www.asyserver.com/~cstrike/rcon.c
Original location isn't available anymore.
